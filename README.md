# AutoTaxonomizer: Developing taxonomic- and morphology-informed neural networks for the analysis and identification of novel macroinvertebrate communities

`AutoTaxonomizer` is a suite of machine learning tools for the automated
analysis of aquatic macorinvertebrate communities including the
identification, enumeration, and size distribution. Details on
navigating the tools and workflows can be found at the [repository
